How to set up your test install of Wicked Words

1	create an empty mysql database - making sure to note down the following:

	database name
	username
	password
	
	if preferred you can set up two database users with the following access levels:
	
	'reader': SELECT, INSERT
	'author': SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE


2	unpack the Wicked Words zip to the server directory of your choice


3	rename ww_config/model_functions.php.txt to ww_config/model_functions.php

	then put in your database connection details on lines 21-31
	
	
4	if you downloaded the files directly from github you may not have a ww_files folder
	if not, create the following folders (in the wickedwords root):

		ww_files
			/_cache
			/attachments
			/images
				/thumbs
				
	...so you should see the following folders in the root directory:
	
		ww_config
		ww_edit
		ww_files
		ww_view
			
5	make sure the entire ww_files folder and all its subfolders are writable


4	now go to what would be the front page of your site e.g http://www.mywickedwords.com/
	
	you should see a prompt to create tables - follow the link and it'll create your database tables
	
	you'll also be prompted to create an author (i.e. admin user)


5	once all that's done you'll be given a link back to the front page of your site

	from there you can append '/admin/' to the url (e.g. http://www.mywickedwords.com/admin/) and log into the 'editroom' to start playing around and uploading stuff
	
	
6	enjoy!
